# Badminton League Tables

Provides a way for badminton leagues to manage the league scoreboard
with constant updates and data integrity.

### TODO:
  - Create a leaderboard table to avoid having to recalculate all the time
  - Look into the jobs/events
    - Could provide a way to run updates when new scorecards are added
    - New table to keep track of which players play for each team
